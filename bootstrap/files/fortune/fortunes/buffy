Acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world. He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act.

Buffy: When I killed him, Angel was cured. Your spell worked at the last minute, Will. I was about to take him out, and, um... something went through him... and he was Angel again. He-he didn't remember anything that he'd done. He just held me. Um, but i-it was... it was too late, and I, I had to. So I, I told him that I loved him... and I kissed him... and I killed him.

I caught her on a park bench, making out with a chaos demon! Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting. She only did it to hurt me.

Angel: I know what's goin' on with you.
Faith: Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.
Angel: Hmm. But I know what it's like to take a life. To feel a future, a world of possibilities, snuffed out by your own hand. I know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me.
Faith: Yeah? Sounds like you need some help. A professional maybe.
Angel: Hmm. A professional couldn't have helped me. It stopped when I got my soul back. My human heart.
Faith: Goody for you. If we're gonna party, let's get on with it. Otherwise, could you let me out of these things?
Angel: Faith, you have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do. I mean, to kill without remorse is to feel like a god.
Faith: Right now, all I feel is a cramp in my wrist, so let me go!
Angel: But you're not a god. You're not much more than a child. Going down this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price for true evil.
Faith: Yeah? I hope evil takes MasterCard.

You and me, Faith, we're a lot alike. Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other. But then I came here. And I found out that there are other types of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. And they make mistakes. And they fall down. You know, but they keep caring. Keep trying. If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change. You don't have to disappear into the darkness.

Willow: I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always, "ooh, you're like a sister to me" or "ooh, you're such a good friend."
Spike: Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
Willow: Really?
Spike: Thought about it.
Willow: When?
Spike: Remember last year, you had on that fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath?
Willow: I never would have guessed. You played the bloodlust kind of cool.
Spike: Hmmm, I hate being obvious, all fangy and GRRR. Takes the mystery out.
Willow: But if you could...?
Spike: If I could...yeah.
Willow: You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.

Buffy-in-Faith: And you have a girlfriend named Olivia, and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school, which is valid, lifestyle-wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker-type, but... Oh, oh! When I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a stevedore during sex. Do you want me to continue?
Giles: Actually, I beg you to stop.
Buffy-in-Faith: What's a stevedore?

Willow: You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies. Probably through a Draconian katra spell.

Buffy: A nest. No biggie. I bet I could do it. I mean, I know I could take at least two.
Anya: Yes. And then we could run for help while the other three suck your heart out through your neck.

The quick draw is about more than speed. It's also about pointing the stake the right way. And there can be splinter issues.

Buffy: Thanks for doing this, Jonathan. I wouldn't ask, but...
Jonathan: Hey, don't worry about it. Nest full of vampires, you come get me, okay. Box full of puppies, that's more of a judgment call.

Xander: I think we did great. We knocked them dead...which they already were.
Willow: We knocked them deader.

Buffy: Anya, when you were a demon, you granted wishes, right?
Anya: Vengeance wishes, on ex-boyfriends. I'd wish he was a dog, or ugly, or in love with President McKinley, or something.
Buffy: But someone could wish the whole earth to be different, right? That's possible?
Anya: Sure, alternate realities. You could have, like, a world without shrimp. Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. You could even make, like, a freaky world where Jonathan's like, some kind of not-perfect mouth-breather, if that's what's blowing up your skirt these days. Just don't ask me to live there.

Buffy: I was just kind wondering...if maybe...anyone else thought...that Jonathan...was kind of too perfect?
Xander: No, he's not. He's just perfect enough. He crushed the bones of The Master, he blew up a big snake made out of Mayor and he coached the US women's soccer team to a stunning World Cup victory. We saw him doing those things.

Buffy: Shut up. Spike.
Spike: Ohoho, semi-harsh language from Betty. You're feisty when the big guys standing beside you. Someday, sweet Slayer, I would love to take you on. See you face the evil alone, for once.

No, but then again, I'm probably lying.

Riley: These spells...these really work? I mean...can you really turn your enemies inside out? Or...learn to excrete gold coins?

Spike: You're not paying me. I'm robbing you.
Anya: Oh, well, now that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me because you've got that chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is... when it's mine.
Spike: Grrrr!
Anya: Oh, now, come on! You're not even bumpy anymore!
Spike: Oh. I was just a minute ago. Hang on. Get me mad again.
Anya: Does this really work? Scaring people into giving you their money?
Spike: Yeah, it works. Keeps me in blood and beers. Plus, you know, funny - watching the little humans quail.

Spike: You know... you take the killing for granted. And then it's gone, and you're like... I wish I'd appreciated it more. Stopped and smelled the corpses, you know?
Anya: Yeah. Now everything's complicated.
Spike: It's a terrible thing, love is. I been there myself. Ended badly.
Anya: Of course it did. It always does. Seen a thousand relationships. First there's the love and sex, then there's nothing left but the vengeance. That's how it works.
Spike: Hey... you and I should just go do the vengeance. Both of us. You eviscerate Xander, and I'll stake Dru. Like a project.

Harmony: I knew you'd take this personally. You're so sensitive! How are you gonna kill her? Think! The second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all "Aaagh!" And then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street, unless she's had enough and just stakes you.

Riley: 'Cause you guys are such tight pals.
Spike: Yeah.
Riley: That's good. Tell me another.
Spike: Okay, how 'bout this one. Twice in recent memory, she's had the lover-wiccas do a deinvite on the house. Keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
Riley: Because you're harmless.
Spike: Oh yeah, right. Takes one to know, I suppose. Least I still got the attitude. What do you got, a piercing glance? Face it, white bread. Buffy's got a type, and you're not it.

No-Show Buffy: Um, about up to here ... well, if you could see my hand, it's kind of above my shoulders.

	-- Xander, "Normal Again" (6x17)
%
Buffy: Sure it is... 'Cause what's more real? A sick girl in an institution?
Dawn: Don't. Please, believe me!!
Buffy: Or some type of. . . supergirl. Chosen to fight demons and save the world? That's ridiculous.

Joyce: Buffy, fight it! You can beat this thing. You're too good to give up. Be strong, honey. I know you're afraid. I know the world feels like a hard place sometimes, but you've got people that love you. Your dad and I, we have all the faith in the world in you. We'll always be with you. There's a world of strength in your heart, honey. I know there is. You just have to find it again. Believe in yourself.
Buffy: You're right... Thank you. Goodbye.
	-- "Normal Again" (6x17)

Willow: Buffy, sit. You'll fall over.
Buffy: No... I can't. Not until I have the antidote.
	-- "Normal Again" (6x17)

I'm so sorry. There's no reaction at all. I'm afraid we've lost her.

You tell them if you want. Go ahead. Rock the boat. Rock and roll it the hell over. My friends and I'll still be groovin' with the movin'. Know why? I tried to kill my friends, my sister, last week and guess how much they hate me now? Zero. Zero much. So I'm thinking, sleeping with you... They'll deal.
	-- Buffy, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Spike: In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?
Buffy: Because I don't love you.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)

Tara: Hey!
Willow: Look at you. All coming-out-of-class and everything.
Tara: I do that sometimes. Usually at the end part of the class.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Tara: How's your... you know, after the basement deal?
Willow: It's between a hitch and a kink. With a side of twinge. It's okay.
Tara: And Buffy's okay too? Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth?
Willow: Ha! Yes! Refreshing san-- that's funny!
Buffy: Okay... can we go in that one?
Dawn: Three pairs of earrings, a change purse and a toothbrush.
Buffy: You stole a toothbrush?
Dawn: Mother of pearl handle. Very fancy.
Buffy: Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush. As rebellious teenagers go, you're kinda square.
Dawn: Dental hygiene is important.

Buffy: Hey, you didn't steal anything from the pet store, did you?
Dawn: Pocketful of goldfish. Didn't work out. No.

I do this wrong, it's gonna surge and we'll be deader than an ex-girlfriend.

Warren:  He's almost done.
Andrew: I sorta feel kinda sorry for him.
Warren: That's a weakness.
Andrew: Um... okay.

%
Xander: I know that there's nothing I can do or say to make up for what I did. I can't -- sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I'm like, oh God, is this my life? Was that me?
Anya: Me too.
Xander: But you have to believe me, please, that I want to make up for it, I want to take away the hurt, I love you. So much.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: Actually, it's really not. Kind of an either-or deal. Do you want to get married?
Xander: Someday, yes, very much. When we're ready. I don't want you to take that as a bad thing, it's good, I love you, I love you so much, I'm just trying to be honest with you --
Anya: Yes, honesty now. Congratulations, Xander, for being honest now, I wonder what the medal will say.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: I haven't been scorned by a man in, like, a thousand years. I never had to make a wish for myself. Isn't there some way around that?
Halfrek: Well... You could try getting someone to make the wish for you. I suppose.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Dawn: Uh, gosh. Did we open a chain? Are we the International House of something?
Buffy: Got up early, seemed like a breakfast kind of morning, what kind of syrup you want on your pancakes?
Dawn: Syrup comes in kinds?

%
Dawn: You guys all went out patrolling every night when you were my age.
Buffy: Yes, well, technically, you're one-and-a-half. See, I thought a little levity might, okay, but also no.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Willow: It was this thing, and it came out from inside her head.
Tara: That's disgusting. What did it look like?
Willow: Well... let's put it this way. If I wasn't gay before...
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Actually, there is an eensy something I could use a little help with. You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. Let's talk about Xander.
	-- Anya, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Buffy: I don't think he could feel any worse.
Anya: Let's test that theory.
Buffy: Anya, Xander's my friend. I know what he did was wrong and if it had happened to me I'd --
Anya: -- wish his penis would explode?
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Tara: It's not really so much about hating the men.
Willow: We're more centered around the girl on girl action.
Anya: And men really like to watch that kind of stuff, don't they? Men like Xander.
Tara: Well, I --
Anya: Don't you wish his eyes would explode?
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Dawn: I never use that word anymore.
Anya: Coagulate?
Dawn: W-i-s-h.
Anya: Oh, wish? As in I wish Xander --
Dawn: Right! That word. There's vengeance demons out there that are still active, remember. Any 'I wish' could totally end in horrible grossness.
Anya: Gimme a fer-instance.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Buffy: I don't really think I should --
Anya: Did I mention the whole "left at the altar" thing? Didn't leave that out, did I?
Buffy: No, I know what he did was wrong. God. I can't imagine -- It must have been torture.
Anya: Okay! Let's talk about torture!
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: Tell me more about wishing Xander's guts and brains would go blooey.
Dawn: I didn't say that.
Anya: Yes you did.
Dawn: No I didn't.
Anya: I heard you.
Dawn: I swear, I didn't say that.
Anya: Didn't say what?
Dawn: Um, I just saw you were back and wanted to talk about working off my debt. You know, my whole Sticky-Fingers-Grabby-Hands-thing?
Anya: Oh! Right, the mad thieving. Good, yes, there 's much to do. I'm gonna put you to work, missy! So, back to Xander's brain and guts...
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)

God! What kind of lesbian are you?! If you love men so much, go love men!
	-- Anya, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Congratulations. They all still love you. Even after what you did to me.
	-- Anya, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Buffy: Or, in the Land of the Sane, you could give her some space and let her
cool down.
Xander: That's not Proactive Guy. That's Sit-Around-And-Wait-For-The-Rest-of-His-
Life-To-Turn-To-Crap Guy.
Buffy: True, but Crap Guy gets to keep all his appendages.

Okay, see, this is why a heart to heart isn't your best course of action here. You're both upset and angry and what the hell is that creepy little thing doing in my yard? Did Willow put that there when I was dead? 'Cause if I had known, I would have crawled out of the grave sooner to kick her 
	-- Buffy, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: It's just, he made a fool of me, and nobody seems to care enough to do anything.
Spike: I care. What he did to you, I've never stooped that low, and I'm an "evil, souless thing" according to some people-
Anya: But shouldn't he pay? Don't you wish he had to pay in some horrible way?
Spike: Absolutely.
Anya: Right. So - hypothetically - what do you wish you could do to him?
Spike: You name it, pet. You're the wronged party. Something gruesome, how 'bout?
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: I'm off my guard. Happy. I'm singing in the shower and doing my sexy dance-
Spike: Exact- I have no dance.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Spike: Never! I was always going above and beyond. I saved the Scoobies how many times? And I can't stand the lot of you.
Anya: Me either! I hate us! Everybody's So "nice." Nobody speaks their mind.
Spike: You do.. That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Spike: Absolutely. I have nothing but respect for a woman who is forthright. Drusilla was always straightforward. Didn't have a single buggering clue about what was going on right in front of her, but she was straight about it. That's a virtue.
Anya: Xander didn't think so. He thought I was rude.
Spike: That's because he's one of them. Uptight. Repressed.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: When, really, I can't sleep at night, thinking - it has to be my fault, somehow-
Spike: Shhhhh-
Anya: I mean, what if he was just pretending? What if he never really wanted me, I mean the way I wanted...
Anya: I have one more question-
Spike: Hmmmmm.
Anya: Can I see your sexy dance?
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Anya: You know I'm only doing this 'cause I'm lonely and I'm drunk and you smell good.
Spike: See? Forthright.

Warren: Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
Jonathan: Oh my God.
Andrew: What are they... oh.
Warren: Is that --
Jonathan: Spike.
Andrew: He is so cool... And, I mean, the girl is hot. Too.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)

Dawn: So... This is it. This is the stuff you've been protecting me from? You and Spike?
Buffy: And a lot of monsters.
Dawn: Uh huh.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Buffy: But it's over. Spike.
Dawn: I wish you'd told me.
Buffy: I kinda didn't admit it to myself.
Dawn: I get that.

Didn't take long, did it?
	-- Buffy, "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Xander: O-oh! Okay... then you had to do it. Because he was there. Like Mt. Everest. Like I used to be.
Anya: And then you weren't. You left me, Xander. At the altar. I don't owe you anything.
Xander: So you bang the first body you can find? Dead or alive?
Anya: Where do you get off judging me-
Xander: When this is your solution to our problems? I hurt you so you get me back? Very mature.
Anya: No, the mature solution is to spend your whole life telling stupid, pointless jokes so no one will notice you're just a scared, insecure little boy!
Xander: I'm not joking now. You let that evil, soulless thing touch you. You wanted me to feel something, congratulations. It worked. I look at you - I feel sick - 'cause you had sex with that.
Spike: Good enough for Buffy.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)
%
Spike: Stupid tossbag. You know, I wish he would --
Anya: Don't.
	-- "Entropy" (6x18)

There's so much to work through. Trust has to build again, on both sides...  you have to learn if you're even the same people you were, if you can fit in each other's lives, it's a long and important process and can we just skip it? Can you just be kissing me now?
	-- Tara, "Entropy" (6x18)

Willow: She told you about Spike?
Dawn: It was kinda obvious last night.
Willow: Yeah, I totally knew.
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Tara: Think that's my cue to put some clothes on.
Dawn: No! I'm totally not here. You guys do whatever you want. I'll watch TV. Really loud. In the basement. Where I can't hear. Anything. Oh my god! Oh my god! I love you guys!

Warren: Welcome to the show, boys.
Andrew: That was so hot!
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)

Buffy: Being here. After I was brought back... You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
Xander: You could have told me.
Buffy: You didn't want to know.
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Spike: Because I care about you.
Buffy: Then you might want to try the not sleeping with my friends.
Spike: That's not... I didn't go to Anya for that. I was looking for a spell.
Buffy: You were going to use a spell on me?
Spike: It wasn't for you. I wanted something -- anything to make this feeling stop. I just wanted it to stop.
Spike: I'll make you feel it...
Buffy: STOP!
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Buffy: Ask me again why I could never love you.
Spike: Oh god. Buffy... I didn't 
Buffy: Because I stopped you. Something I should have done a long time ago.
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Warren: Okay. But can I ask you something first? You think maybe you could put a word in for me with that Anya chick? 'Cause if she's taking it from a vamp, I think I might have a chance -- No wonder she's screwing a dead guy. You hit like a girl.
Xander: At least I know how to get one.
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Tara: It's not written in any ancient language we could identify --
Xander: It's Klingon. They're love poems -- which have nothing to do with the insidious scheme you're about to describe.

%
Spike: We were never together. Not really. She wouldn't lower herself that far.
Clem:  She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey. Issues. And no wonder, with the coming back from the grave and whatnot. I had this cousin, got resurrected by some kooky  shaman -- who-boy! Was that a mess!

Jonathan: Jet packs. You jerks were setting me up to take the fall.
Andrew: He left me. He flew away and left me.

How could he do that to me? He promised we'd be together. He was just using me. He never really loved -- hanging out with us.
	-- Andrew, "Seeing Red" (6x19)
%
Xander: Time for the Spring Poking already?
Buffy: Just making sure there's no more Evil Trio cameras. Or Evil Uno.
Xander: The sinister yet addictive card game?
Buffy: Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got klinked, but Warren pulled a Rocket Man. It was a thing.
	-- "Seeing Red" (6x19)

Buffy: I'm sorry. I should have told you.
Xander: Maybe you would have. If I hadn't given you so many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it.

Buffy: Let's not find out. I love you. You know that. Right?

Willow: Please. Please... Bring her back-
Demon: You may not violate the laws of natural passing-
Willow: How? How is this natural?
Demon: It is a human death, by human means.
Willow: But I-
Demon: You raised one killed by mystical forces. This is not the same  she is taken by natural order. It is done.

%
Andrew: He will. He's just coming up with a plan. Like in "War Games", remember? That decoder Matthew Broderick used?
Jonathan: Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made from the scissors and tape recorder?
Andrew: I miss "Ferris" Matthew. "Broadway" Matthew - I find him cold.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)

Jonathan: What do you mean - what do I mean? You guys were totally going to fly off and leave me holding the bag-
Andrew: We were not! I was going to carry you.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Warren: Had my own guys, the Trio - you've heard of us-
Rack: Right. What were you, a band or something?
Warren: I thought word traveled in the underworld. We were evil? Robots were my thing. You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Rack: I can't guarantee anything. Not this time. The girl is running on fury. Never felt anything like it.
Warren: Thanks for the tip. Nostradamus.
Xander: You've got to stop doing this. I mean the dying thing is funny once. Maybe twice-
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Buffy: And we'll catch him - and he'll go to jail. Believe me, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating.
Xander: You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask - what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair-
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Willow: He hit Tara. When he shot you, he hit her too. Upstairs. In my room.
Buffy: Oh my God-
Willow: Guess the last shot was the charm.
Xander: She's dead?
Willow: She's dead. And now he's dead.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Dawn: I do. And you should too. He killed Tara - and he nearly killed you. He needs to pay.
Xander: Out of the mouths of babes.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Buffy: Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to, the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And we'd be able to bring Tara back...
Dawn: And mom.
Buffy: There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe it - and now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
Xander: I just - I've had blood on my hands all day. Blood from people I love.
Buffy: I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise you. But I won't let Willow destroy herself.

Or we could rent videos. I've been dying to see The Wedding Planner.
	-- Clem, "Villains" (6x20)
%
Anya: I don't need a spell. I can feel her.
Xander: You can...
Anya: Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
Xander: Is that like, left over, from your vengeance demon days? That you can sense her?
Anya: Not left over.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Xander: Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
Buffy: Oh.
Xander: So Willow's all wrathy - why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Xander: If you know where she is - you can help us.
Anya: I'll help. But I'm helping Willow.
Willow: Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend you killed my girlfriend-
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Warren: God - women. You're just like the rest of them. Mind games-
Willow: Now you get off on it. That's why you had such a mad-on for the slayer. She was the big O - wasn't she, Warren?
	-- "Villains" (6x20)
%
Warren: When you get caught - you'll lose them too. Your friends. You don't want that. I know... You're in pain but-
Willow: Bored now.

%
Xander: Oh my God.
Buffy: Willow - no... What did you do?
Willow: One down.
	-- "Villains" (6x20)

Anya: No she couldn't. A witch at her level? She could only go airborne. It's a thing. Very flashy, impresses the locals, but it does take longer.
Xander: Longer than what?
Anya: Teleporting.

Andrew: I'm telling him you said that.
Jonathan: Why wait - I'll tell him myself. Come in, Warren, do you read me, your girlfriend's pathetic, over.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)

Anya: Warren shot Buffy. Warren shot Tara. Buffy's alive. Tara's dead. Willow found out and being the most powerful Wicca in the western hemisphere, she went for the payback. With interest.
Andrew: Wh-what about Warren?
Anya: She killed him. Ripped him apart and bloodied up the forest doing it. Now she's coming here and you two are next.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Andrew: Stop it! Just, stop! Why is she doing this? Tell her! We didn't do anything.
Jonathan: Yes we did. We signed on. We teamed up. We wanted to see where all our plans would take us, well take a look.

Clem: So gritty. Kinda hurts my tongue, so I'd give 'em... a seven. Seven-five  maybe and you think this is dumb, don't you?
Dawn: No! As taste tests go, this is definitely one of the better ones I've been to.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)

Still, I feel responsible. It's not fair - girl your age, cooped up in a crypt. Tell you what: let me get my hat and coat - I'll take you to a movie. We'll go nuts.  PG- thirteen.

Willow: No, honey. I am the Magicks.

Willow: Did you cry? Of course you did. I get that, I understand the crying, you cry because you're human. But you weren't always.
Dawn: Yes I was...
Willow: No - please, you're telling me you don't remember? You used to be ...what, some mystic ball of energy. Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, "Dawny." You don't belong here.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Willow: Wanna go back? End the pain? You'll be happier. I'd be happier. We'll all be a lot happier without having to listen to all your constant whining.
Dawn: Willow... stop...
Willow: "Mom!" "Buffy!" "Tara!" Waah! Come on, someone's gotta stop the carnage. It's time you went back to being a little energy ball.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)

Andrew: Then what? You think your Li'l Witch buddy's gonna stop with us? You saw her! She's a truck driving Magic Mamma. We've got maybe seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds everybody into Jawa-burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midiclorians to stop her.
Xander: You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?
Anya: The annoying virgin has a point.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Anya: She tried to use you for a hood ornament, Xander. She doesn't care if you live or die.
Xander: Guess you two finally have something in common
Anya: I care if you live or die, Xander. I'm just not sure which one I want.
Xander: Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at Wiccapalooza. If it gets really bad --
Anya: Let me guess. You'll propose.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Xander: Right, 'cause you varnishing the table with Spike -- how could that possibly have hurt? It may have chaffed...
Anya: That wasn't vengeance. It was solace.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Xander: You think I don't know that? You think I'm the hero of this piece? I saw the gun. Before Warren even raised it, I saw it, and... I couldn't move. He shot two of  my friends before I could even... You want me to know how useless I am? That it's my fault? Thanks. Already got the memo.
Anya: I was talking about us.

Willow: Let me tell you something about Willow: she's a loser. And she always has been. Everyone picked on Willow in junior high, high school, up until college with her stupid mousy ways and now - Willow's a junkie.
Buffy: I can help.
Willow: The only thing Willow was ever good for...- the only thing going for me - were those moments  just moments - when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. And that will never happen again.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Buffy: Because you lose everything. Your friends, your self... you let this control you and the world goes away. That's not... Willow, there's so much to --
Willow: Ack! Please! This is your pitch? You hate it here as much as I do. I'm just more honest about it.
Buffy: That's not true...
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)

You're trying to sell me on the world. The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them and you screw a vampire just to feel and insane asylums are the comfy alternative. This world? Buffy, it's me! I know you were happier in the ground - hanging with the worms. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back.

Willow: Come on! This is a huge deal for me! Six years as a side man, and now I get to be the Slayer.
Buffy: A killer isn't a Slayer. Being a Slayer means something you can't conceive of.
Willow: Oh, Buffy. You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked.
Buffy: Then show me what you got. And I'll show you what a Slayer is.
	-- "Two To Go" (6x21)
%
Willow: Buffy, I gotta tell you - I get it now. The Slayer thing really isn't about the violence. It's about the power. And there's no one in the world with the power to stop me now.
Giles: I'd like to test that theory.

Buffy: What did you do?
Giles: Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of stasis for the time--You've cut your hair.

Giles: Buffy, what's happened here?
Buffy: God. I don't know where to start-
Giles: Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the majicks-
Buffy: She has. She was - and I barely even noticed. Everything's been so... Dawn's a total klepto, Xander left Anya at the altar and Anya became a demon again. And I - I'm so... I've been sleeping with Spike.

Anya: I know what you're trying to do. Hate to burst your bubble, but mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just--

Giles: Duct tape?

Xander: Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.

Giles: I see. You lose someone you love and the other people in your life... The ones who cares about you become meaningless.  I wonder... What would Tara say about that?

Giles: Silly girl. I'm dying.
Anya: No, you're not.

Buffy: So, seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true.
Anya: She's going to drain the planet's life force, funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and burn the Earth to a cinder.

Anya: Something else Giles said. No magic or supernatural force can stop her.
Buffy: What does that mean?
Anya: I don't know. He said "the Slayer can't stop her." Then he said a bunch of other stuff... he wasn't too... clear. I should hurry and get back to him. He's... alone.

Giles? Giles. Don't die. Not yet. I... There are... I need to tell you...Thanks a lot for coming. I mean, it was nice of you to teleport all this way-- Though, in retrospect, it might have been better if you hadn't come and given her all that magic that made her ten times more powerful... that would have been a plus.

Xander: Yeah, I get that. It's just  where else am I going to go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end - where else would I want to be?
Willow: Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
Xander: Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but it seemed kinda cartoony.

%
Xander: I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid and hey, still want to hang. You're Willow.
Willow: Don't call me th-
Xander: First day of kindergarten you cried 'cause you broke the yellow crayon and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion but the thing is, yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. You wanna kill the world, you start with me. I've earned that.
	-- "Grave" (6x22)
%
Giles: W-well, I knew there was a possibility. The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of Magic. Which comes, in all it's purity, from the Earth itself. Willow's magic came from a place of rage and power.
Anya: Oh, and vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
Giles: How... could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into the spark of humanity she had left. Allowed her to feel again... Giving Xander the opportunity to reach her.
Anya: Xander?
Giles: Yes. It was he that got to her in time. He saved us all.

D'Hoffryn: Who did you think you were dealing with? Did you think it would be that easy to get away?
Anya: Why?
D'Hoffryn: Why? Because you wished it!

Anya: You should've killed me.
D'Hoffryn: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. From beneath you, it devours. Be patient. All good things in time.

Anya: Yes, I should. My whole life, I've just clung to whatever came along.
Xander: Well, speaking as a clingee - I kinda didn't mind.
Anya: Thanks. For everything.

Anya: Xander - what if I'm really nobody?
Xander: Don't be a dope.
Anya: I'm a dope?
Xander: Sometimes.
Anya: That's a start.

You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now.

Xander: Are you keeping up, or do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?
Buffy: Invitation.
Xander: Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan? Fine. I invite you in. Nimrod.

Dawn: It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole -
Buffy: No. A thousand gallons of no.

Spike: I'll go. This can't work.
Buffy: It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
Spike: Bollocks.
Buffy: OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but -
Spike: No, bollocks to the whole thing. I don't need your mollycoddling.
Buffy: It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.

Well, I-I guess you guys could use my help. Willow's not very good with the practical strategizing - except when she's evil. And Dawn - she's not really good for anything.

Right, with the wailing and the crying... Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?

Remember when she used to have a crush on me? I miss the much cuter "me" crush.

Buffy: That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.

It's the jacket. It's true. Something about the big letter on the chest makes girls get all swoony and crushy. I saw it all the time in school. And you couldn't just pin any old felt letter to your coat and get play - not that I tried.

Xander: Well, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less bl-bl-bl-bl-bl. I'm just saying... once you get back the soul, doesn't that mean you start, like, picking up your own wet towels off the floor?
Willow: No, but maybe you start to feel really bad about leaving them there.
Buffy: At least he's showering, and that's a refreshing and delightful change.

So, do you have plans later, or are you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?

OK, first with the lap dance, now with the catfight. Hey, you wanna get drunk and barf next?

Xander: I just called him "that guy in the jacket".
Dawn: That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!

Now get off the boy, Buffy. We're going home.

Buffy: I betrayed you? You're the one that constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover.
Dawn: Your lover? You're lover!

Why? Because he's younger than me? You know, I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.

Willow: Damn love spell. I have tried every anti-love spell spell I could find.
Anya: Even if you find the right one, the guy would probably just do an anti-anti-love spell spell... spell.

Willow: But you don't even know him!
Anya: Yes, I do. I looked into him and saw his soul.
Willow: He was walking away, so unless his soul was in his ass -

Buffy: Willow, you're a gay woman - and he isn't.
Willow: This isn't about his physical presence. It's about his heart.

There's a simple answer to this. Just think about who loves him the most. Clearly I do, since I'm willing to look past the whole orientation thing.

Anya: Well, you're gonna have to do better than that - I'd kill for him.
Willow: You'd kill for a chocolate bar.

Willow: Yeah, well I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
Anya: Yeah, right. What're you gonna do - use magic to make him into a girl? Damn.

Willow: Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over. Hecate hates that.
Xander: What the hell are you doing?
Willow: Proving I love R.J. the most!
Xander: Will, honey... R.J.'s a guy.
Willow: I did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know, he doesn't have to be.

Buffy: Well, I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.

Dawn: But I - I thought you wanted him... for you.
Buffy: Nah. Well, yeah. My God, that boy is hot. Sorry. I think I might be under a spell here.

Buffy: Xander, be honest. You didn't, you know, think about slipping that jacket on just a little bit?
Xander: I refuse to answer that on the grounds that it didn't fit.

Anya: It was a spell. You were helpless. We're not responsible for anything we did morally or, you know, legally...
Xander: True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who hasn't made that mistake seven, eight times?
